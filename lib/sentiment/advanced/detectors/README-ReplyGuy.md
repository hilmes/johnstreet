# Reply Guy Analytics Detector

The `ReplyGuyDetector` is a sophisticated analytics tool designed to analyze response patterns in social media conversations to distinguish between organic engagement and artificial manipulation. It provides comprehensive metrics for bot detection, quality scoring, and organic growth identification.

## Overview

The detector analyzes conversations and responses to:
- Calculate bot-to-human ratios in discussions
- Measure engagement authenticity scores
- Track reply velocity and quality trends
- Identify organic engagement spikes vs artificial pumps
- Detect coordinated manipulation campaigns

## Usage

### Basic Implementation

```typescript
import { ReplyGuyDetector } from './detectors/ReplyGuyDetector';
import { TextInput } from './types';

// Create detector instance
const detector = new ReplyGuyDetector({
  sensitivity: 0.7,      // Detection sensitivity (0-1)
  minConfidence: 0.4,    // Minimum confidence threshold
  debugMode: true        // Enable detailed logging
});

// Analyze a conversation with responses
const conversation: TextInput = {
  text: "Discussion about market trends",
  source: "twitter",
  author: "market_analyst",
  metadata: {
    conversationId: "trend_discussion_123",
    responses: [
      {
        text: "What's your take on the recent market volatility?",
        author: "trader_pro",
        timestamp: new Date(Date.now() - 300000),
        followers: 5000
      },
      {
        text: "I think we're seeing healthy consolidation after the rally.",
        author: "crypto_analyst",
        timestamp: new Date(Date.now() - 240000),
        followers: 12000
      }
      // ... more responses
    ]
  }
};

// Perform analysis
const result = await detector.detect(conversation);

if (result) {
  console.log(`Signal Strength: ${result.strength}`); // -1 to 1 scale
  console.log(`Confidence: ${result.metadata.confidence}`);
  console.log(`Bot Ratio: ${result.indicators.responseMetrics.botToHumanRatio}`);
  console.log(`Organic Score: ${result.indicators.engagementAuthenticity.organicScore}`);
}
```

### Batch Analysis

```typescript
// Analyze multiple conversations
const conversations: TextInput[] = [
  // ... array of conversation inputs
];

const results = await detector.detectBatch(conversations);
results.forEach(result => {
  console.log(`Conversation ${result.metadata.source}: ${result.strength}`);
});
```

### Real-time Monitoring

```typescript
import { createReplyGuyMonitor } from './examples/reply-guy-usage';

const monitor = createReplyGuyMonitor({
  alertThreshold: -0.5,
  onSuspiciousActivity: (signal) => {
    console.log(`ðŸš¨ Suspicious activity detected in ${signal.conversationId}`);
    console.log(`Bot ratio: ${signal.botRatio}`);
    console.log(`Manipulation tactics: ${signal.manipulationIndicators.join(', ')}`);
  },
  onOrganicGrowth: (signal) => {
    console.log(`ðŸ“ˆ Organic growth potential in ${signal.conversationId}`);
    console.log(`Viral potential: ${signal.viralPotential}`);
  }
});

// Monitor conversations in real-time
await monitor.analyzeConversation(incomingConversation);
```

## Signal Interpretation

### Signal Strength Scale
- **+0.7 to +1.0**: Highly organic engagement with authentic discussions
- **+0.3 to +0.7**: Mostly organic with good quality indicators
- **-0.3 to +0.3**: Mixed or neutral engagement patterns
- **-0.7 to -0.3**: Likely artificial with suspicious patterns
- **-1.0 to -0.7**: Highly artificial with clear bot/manipulation indicators

### Key Metrics Interpretation

#### Bot-to-Human Ratio
- **0.0 - 0.2**: Healthy organic discussion
- **0.2 - 0.4**: Some suspicious accounts present
- **0.4 - 0.7**: Concerning level of bot activity
- **0.7 - 1.0**: Dominated by bot accounts

#### Organic Score
- **0.8 - 1.0**: Highly authentic engagement
- **0.6 - 0.8**: Good organic indicators
- **0.4 - 0.6**: Mixed authenticity signals
- **0.2 - 0.4**: Likely manipulated content
- **0.0 - 0.2**: Clear artificial manipulation

#### Coordination Score
- **0.0 - 0.3**: Natural, uncoordinated activity
- **0.3 - 0.6**: Some coordination patterns
- **0.6 - 0.8**: Likely coordinated campaign
- **0.8 - 1.0**: Clear coordinated manipulation

## Bot Detection Patterns

### Username Patterns
- Numeric suffixes (e.g., `crypto_trader_1234`)
- CamelCase with numbers (e.g., `MoonHunter2023`)
- Common bot keywords: `bot`, `pump`, `moon`, `gem`

### Content Patterns
- Generic phrases: "great project", "to the moon", "bullish"
- Excessive emojis: ðŸš€ðŸ’ŽðŸŒ™ðŸ“ˆðŸ’°
- Template responses: "Wow great project!", "This is huge!"
- Shill indicators: "100x gains", "presale", "don't miss"

### Behavioral Patterns
- Rapid response times (< 30 seconds)
- High linguistic similarity between responses
- Temporal clustering of messages
- Low follower-to-age ratios

## Manipulation Detection

### Common Manipulation Indicators
- **high_bot_ratio**: >40% of responses from suspicious accounts
- **suspicious_timing**: Unnatural response timing patterns
- **generic_content**: >50% generic or template responses
- **coordinated_messages**: Synchronized messaging patterns

### Activity Spike Analysis
The detector identifies unusual activity bursts and classifies them:
- **Organic Spikes**: Natural viral growth with quality content
- **Bot Spikes**: Artificial pumping with generic content
- **Coordinated Spikes**: Organized campaigns with similar messaging

## Configuration Options

### Sensitivity Settings
- **Low (0.1-0.3)**: Conservative detection, fewer false positives
- **Medium (0.4-0.6)**: Balanced detection for general use
- **High (0.7-0.9)**: Aggressive detection, catches subtle patterns

### Confidence Thresholds
- **Low (0.1-0.3)**: Accept signals with minimal evidence
- **Medium (0.4-0.6)**: Require moderate evidence strength
- **High (0.7-0.9)**: Only high-confidence detections
