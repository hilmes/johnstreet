# AI-Assisted Development Guidelines
*Embody grace and simplicity and user accessibility. Kaizen.*

## MCP Tools Integration

Our development workflow leverages Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools to enhance productivity and maintain quality:

- **Memory** (`memory`): Persistent knowledge graph for project context and standards
- **Sequential Thinking** (`sequential-thinking`): Structured problem-solving for complex tasks
- **Puppeteer** (`puppeteer`): Automated testing and visual verification

## Core Development Principles

```javascript
// Store component standards in persistent memory
await mcp.memory_create_entities({
  entities: [{
    name: "ComponentStandards",
    entityType: "DevelopmentStandard",
    observations: [
      "Make codebase modular, not monolithic",
      "Target file size ~500 lines (Â±100 lines)"
    ]
  }]
});
```

- Make our codebase as modular as possible, not monolithic
- Files should be around ~500 lines in length (+/- 100 lines)
- Component files should follow size guidelines:
  - UI Components: 50-150 lines (pure presentation components)
  - Container Components: 100-300 lines (data/state management)
  - Page Components: 200-400 lines (composition of smaller components)
- Split components when:
  - Handling multiple distinct responsibilities
  - Conditional rendering becomes complex
  - Component accepts too many props (7-10+)
  - Readability decreases (requires excessive scrolling)
  - Parts could be reused elsewhere in the application

### Component Analysis with Sequential Thinking

```javascript
// Use structured reasoning to analyze component complexity
await mcp.mcp_sequential-thinking_sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Analyzing InspectionTracker component for potential splitting points",
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 5,
  nextThoughtNeeded: true
});
```

## Code Quality & Standards

```javascript
// Store quality standards in memory for consistent reference
await mcp.memory_create_entities({
  entities: [{
    name: "CodeQualityStandards",
    entityType: "DevelopmentStandard",
    observations: [
      "TypeScript-first approach with strict typing",
      "ES module syntax required",
      "Comprehensive error handling for all async operations"
    ]
  }]
});
```

- Follow project conventions: Always adhere to existing code style, naming conventions, and project structure
- TypeScript first: Use TypeScript for all new files with proper type definitions
- Use ES module syntax
- Error handling: Implement comprehensive error handling for all API calls and async operations
- Documentation: Add JSDoc comments for all functions, classes, and complex code blocks
- Configure AI rules to automatically enforce coding standards

### Quality Verification with Puppeteer

```javascript
// Automated verification of component rendering
await mcp.mcp_puppeteer_puppeteer_navigate({
  url: "http://localhost:3000/component-sandbox"
});
await mcp.mcp_puppeteer_puppeteer_screenshot({
  name: "component-verification",
  selector: ".target-component"
});
```

## API and Data Management

```javascript
// Document API patterns in memory
await mcp.memory_create_entities({
  entities: [{
    name: "JetNetApiStandards",
    entityType: "ApiStandard",
    observations: [
      "Always pass token in header when using JetNetApi",
      "Use SWR or React Query for data fetching and caching",
      "Implement automatic token renewal logic"
    ]
  }]
});
```

- Always pass token in header when using JetNetApi (as per documentation)
- Implement appropriate caching strategies for API responses
- Handle all potential error states from APIs
- Implement exponential backoff for failed requests
- Log all API interactions at appropriate levels (debug vs. error)
- Implement automatic token renewal logic when tokens expire
- Use centralized API client configuration
- Use SWR or React Query for data fetching and caching
- Use Zod or similar libraries for runtime data validation

### API Integration Planning

```javascript
// Use sequential thinking for API implementation planning
await mcp.mcp_sequential-thinking_sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Designing caching strategy for aircraft data endpoints",
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 4,
  nextThoughtNeeded: true
});
```

## Authentication & Security

```javascript
// Document security requirements in memory
await mcp.memory_create_entities({
  entities: [{
    name: "SecurityStandards",
    entityType: "SecurityRequirement",
    observations: [
      "Use Auth.js (NextAuth v5+) for OAuth",
      "Sanitize all user inputs",
      "Store secrets in environment variables only"
    ]
  }]
});
```

- Use Auth.js (NextAuth v5 or higher) for OAuth
- Sanitize inputs: Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Avoid hard-coded secrets: Never include API keys, tokens, or passwords in code
- Implement CSRF protection for all form submissions
- Use React's built-in XSS protections; avoid dangerouslySetInnerHTML
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- Use automated tools to scan for security vulnerabilities

### Security Testing

```javascript
// Test authentication flows with Puppeteer
await mcp.mcp_puppeteer_puppeteer_navigate({
  url: "http://localhost:3000/api/auth/signin"
});
await mcp.mcp_puppeteer_puppeteer_fill({
  selector: "input[name='email']",
  value: "test@example.com"
});
```

## Performance Optimization

```javascript
// Track performance requirements in memory
await mcp.memory_create_entities({
  entities: [{
    name: "PerformanceStandards",
    entityType: "OptimizationRequirement",
    observations: [
      "Configure Edge Runtime for all API routes",
      "Use React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback appropriately",
      "Implement lazy loading for routes and large components"
    ]
  }]
});
```

- Edge Runtime for Vercel should be configured properly for all API routes
- Memoization: Use React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback appropriately
- Regular bundle size analysis with optimizations
- Implement lazy loading for routes and large components
- Use next/image or similar for image optimization
- Break down large components to improve code splitting
- Regularly review and optimize critical paths

### Performance Testing

```javascript
// Measure performance with Puppeteer
await mcp.mcp_puppeteer_puppeteer_evaluate({
  script: `
    performance.mark('start-render');
    // Code to test
    performance.mark('end-render');
    performance.measure('render-time', 'start-render', 'end-render');
    return performance.getEntriesByType('measure');
  `
});
```

## File & Component Organization

```javascript
// Document organization patterns in memory
await mcp.memory_create_entities({
  entities: [{
    name: "FileOrganizationStandards",
    entityType: "OrganizationStandard",
    observations: [
      "Group related components in directories",
      "Use partials folders for component-specific sub-components",
      "Create shared/common component libraries"
    ]
  }]
});
```

- Group related components in directories
- Use "partials" folders for component-specific sub-components
- Create shared/common component libraries for reusable elements
- Implement project-wide patterns and refactoring consistently
- Review all code changes before applying

### Organization Analysis

```javascript
// Analyze project structure with Sequential Thinking
await mcp.mcp_sequential-thinking_sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Evaluating current component organization and identifying improvements",
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 3,
  nextThoughtNeeded: true
});
```

## Development Workflow

```javascript
// Store workflow guidelines in memory
await mcp.memory_create_entities({
  entities: [{
    name: "DevelopmentWorkflow",
    entityType: "WorkflowStandard",
    observations: [
      "Never use mock data",
      "Ask before installing new dependencies",
      "Use startup command: (lsof -i :3000,3001 | awk 'NR>1 {print $2}' | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null; npm run dev) & npx @agentdeskai/browser-tools-server"
    ]
  }]
});
```

- Never use mock data
- Ask before installing new dependencies
- Always use the prescribed startup command
- Enable Turbopack with the --turbopack flag
- Don't change ports without asking
- Implement feature flags for larger changes
- Clear local storage when schema changes
- Ensure all UI components meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Schedule regular code cleanup sessions

### Workflow Automation

```javascript
// Test workflow with Puppeteer
await mcp.mcp_puppeteer_puppeteer_navigate({
  url: "http://localhost:3000/development-status"
});
await mcp.mcp_puppeteer_puppeteer_screenshot({
  name: "workflow-verification"
});
```

## AI-Assisted Development

```javascript
// Track AI assistance patterns in memory
await mcp.memory_create_entities({
  entities: [{
    name: "AIAssistanceGuidelines",
    entityType: "DevelopmentStandard",
    observations: [
      "Reference project documentation in AI prompts",
      "Provide component purpose and design patterns in prompts",
      "Use iterative approach for complex changes"
    ]
  }]
});
```

- Reference project documentation in AI prompts
- Provide context about component purpose and design patterns in use
- Use iterative approach for complex changes (generate, review, refine)
- Include error handling expectations and performance requirements in prompts
- Generate tests when creating new functionality
- Use follow-up questions to improve generated code

### AI-Assistance Enhancement

```javascript
// Use Sequential Thinking for complex problems
await mcp.mcp_sequential-thinking_sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Designing optimal API caching strategy for aircraft data",
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 6,
  nextThoughtNeeded: true
});
```

## Version Control & Deployment

```javascript
// Document deployment procedures in memory
await mcp.memory_create_entities({
  entities: [{
    name: "DeploymentStandards",
    entityType: "DeploymentGuideline",
    observations: [
      "Make small, focused commits with clear messages",
      "Follow Git Flow branching strategy",
      "Create release notes in /docs/release-notes before deployment"
    ]
  }]
});
```

- Atomic commits: Make small, focused commits with clear messages
- Follow Git Flow or similar branching strategy
- Generate a checklist for code reviews
- Use standardized PR templates
- Create detailed release notes before every deployment
- Use Vercel CLI commands for deployments
- Ensure environment variables are properly configured

### Deployment Verification

```javascript
// Verify deployment with Puppeteer
await mcp.mcp_puppeteer_puppeteer_navigate({
  url: "https://preview-deployment-url.vercel.app"
});
await mcp.mcp_puppeteer_puppeteer_screenshot({
  name: "deployment-verification"
});
```

## Debugging and Monitoring

```javascript
// Document debugging procedures in memory
await mcp.memory_create_entities({
  entities: [{
    name: "DebuggingStandards",
    entityType: "DebuggingGuideline",
    observations: [
      "Use consistent logging format",
      "Add performance marks for critical user flows",
      "Integrate with error tracking service"
    ]
  }]
});
```

- Structured logging: Use a consistent logging format
- Performance monitoring: Add performance marks for critical user flows
- Error tracking: Integrate with error tracking service
- User analytics: Implement analytics for key user actions
- Regularly analyze and improve error handling patterns

### Debugging Assistance

```javascript
// Use Sequential Thinking for complex debugging
await mcp.mcp_sequential-thinking_sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Debugging SSR hydration mismatch in aircraft component",
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 5,
  nextThoughtNeeded: true
});
```

## Testing Standards

```javascript
// Document testing requirements in memory
await mcp.memory_create_entities({
  entities: [{
    name: "TestingStandards",
    entityType: "TestingGuideline",
    observations: [
      "Unit tests with Jest/Vitest targeting >80% coverage",
      "Integration tests for all API endpoints",
      "E2E tests for critical user journeys with Puppeteer"
    ]
  }]
});
```

- Unit tests: Jest/Vitest with >80% coverage for business logic
- Integration tests: API endpoint validation with proper mocking
- E2E tests: Critical user journey validation with Puppeteer
- Test file naming: `*.test.js`, `*.spec.js`, or `*.test.ts` for TypeScript
- Test structure: Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Mock external dependencies and API calls
- Run tests before committing: `npm test` or project-specific test command
- Write tests when fixing bugs to prevent regression
- Use test data builders for complex objects

### Test Implementation Example

```javascript
// Example test structure
describe('AircraftComponent', () => {
  it('should render aircraft details correctly', async () => {
    // Arrange
    const mockAircraft = buildAircraftData();
    
    // Act
    const { getByText } = render(<AircraftComponent data={mockAircraft} />);
    
    // Assert
    expect(getByText(mockAircraft.model)).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

## Claude Code Workflow

```javascript
// Document Claude Code best practices in memory
await mcp.memory_create_entities({
  entities: [{
    name: "ClaudeCodeWorkflow",
    entityType: "WorkflowGuideline",
    observations: [
      "Use TodoWrite for tasks with 3+ steps",
      "Prefer Task tool for open-ended searches",
      "Run linting/type checking after code changes"
    ]
  }]
});
```

- Use TodoWrite for tasks with 3+ steps or complex multi-file changes
- Prefer Task tool for open-ended searches requiring multiple rounds
- Use Read for specific files, Glob for patterns, Grep for content search
- Always run linting/type checking after code changes
- Check for existing test/lint commands in package.json before asking
- Use `make tail-logs` for debugging when working with unified logging
- Reference file locations with `path/to/file.js:lineNumber` format
- Batch multiple tool calls when gathering information
- Write to CLAUDE.md for project-specific instructions that persist

### Tool Selection Guide

```javascript
// Example: Choosing the right search tool
// Use Glob when you know the file pattern
await glob({ pattern: "**/*Controller.js" });

// Use Grep when searching for specific content
await grep({ pattern: "handleSubmit", glob: "*.tsx" });

// Use Task when search is complex or iterative
await task({ 
  prompt: "Find all API endpoints that handle authentication",
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
});
```

## Project Documentation

```javascript
// Track documentation requirements in memory
await mcp.memory_create_entities({
  entities: [{
    name: "DocumentationStandards",
    entityType: "DocumentationGuideline",
    observations: [
      "Update architecture diagrams when architecture changes",
      "Maintain up-to-date API documentation",
      "Keep developer onboarding guide updated"
    ]
  }]
});
```

- Update architecture diagrams when architecture changes
- Maintain up-to-date API documentation
- Keep the developer onboarding guide updated
- Maintain a user-facing changelog for significant updates
- Document Vercel-specific deployment configurations
- Document component purpose, props, and usage examples

### Knowledge Preservation

```javascript
// Store project knowledge persistently
await mcp.memory_create_relations({
  relations: [
    {
      from: "AircraftPurchaseComponent",
      relationType: "implements",
      to: "JetNetApiStandards" 
    },
    {
      from: "AircraftPurchaseComponent",
      relationType: "follows",
      to: "ComponentStandards"
    }
  ]
});
```
